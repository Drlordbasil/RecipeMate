## Description

The Web-based Recipe Recommender is a Python project that encompasses the following components:

- **Web Scraping:** The program scrapes recipe websites using tools such as BeautifulSoup or Google Python to extract recipe data. This includes information such as recipe titles, ingredients, cooking instructions, and user ratings.

- **User Preference Capture:** The program prompts users to input their dietary preferences, allergies, cooking expertise, and any specific ingredients they want to use or avoid. This information is stored for generating personalized recommendations.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The scraped recipe data is cleaned, processed, and transformed into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. This involves tasks such as removing duplicate recipes, standardizing ingredient names, and encoding categorical variables.

- **Machine Learning Model:** The program employs machine learning algorithms to build a recipe recommendation system based on user preferences and the available recipe data. Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach can be used to generate accurate recommendations.

- **Personalized Recommendations:** The program generates personalized recipe recommendations for each user by matching their preferences with the stored recipe data. The recommendations take into account factors such as dietary requirements, cooking expertise, and ingredient preferences.

- **Recipe Retrieval:** Once the program generates personalized recommendations, it provides links or instructions to retrieve the full recipe details from the original source website. This ensures that users have access to the complete recipe with cooking instructions, serving sizes, and additional information.

- **User Feedback and Improvement:** The program incorporates user feedback by allowing users to rate and review the recommended recipes. This data can be used to continuously improve the recommendation system and fine-tune the machine learning model.
